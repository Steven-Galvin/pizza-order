## Description

This is a fake pizza page designed to demonstrate my understanding and skill using javascript and jquery. The user will experience a seemingly simple web page, but taking a look at the scripts file you can see there's much more to it. Using objects, arrays, and constructors, I'm able to gather data from the user and manipulate it to determine a total price as well as return the info back at the user for confirmation. https://steven-galvin.github.io/pizza-order/
